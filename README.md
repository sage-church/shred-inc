SUMMARY:

Landing page for a guitar rental company.

BUILT WITH:
- HTML
- CSS

SETTING IT UP:

Since there are only five files total for the project, the css and html urls/links were coded with the intention of all the
project files sitting in the same folder.

Once the files are correctly stored on the computer, opening the index.html file in a browser should be successful.

No installations are needed to load the page.
